# Documentation Audit (Lab Gateway)

Audit date: 2026-02-14
Scope: all project docs except `blockchain-services/*`.

## Result

Status: mostly aligned after this pass.

Main fixes applied:

1. `README.md`
- Corrected local access endpoints (everything enters through OpenResty by default).
- Clarified `public_key.pem` behavior (auto-generated by `blockchain-services` if missing).
- Corrected `/treasury/admin/**` access model (strict `TREASURY_TOKEN`).
- Corrected `/ops` network restriction (`127.0.0.1` and `172.16.0.0/12`).

2. `LOGGING.md`
- Rewritten to match current `docker-compose.yml` logging config.
- Migrated commands to `docker compose`.
- Added `blockchain-services` and `ops-worker` rotation limits.

3. `docs/install/INSTALLATION_GUIDE_EN.md`
- Post-install checks now explicitly support non-443 bind ports.

4. `docs/install/GUIA_INSTALACION_ES.md`
- Same post-install validation fix as English guide.

5. `ops-worker/README.md`
- Simplified and aligned with implemented API routes.
- Added missing endpoints (`/api/reservations/timeline`, `/api/hosts/reload`, `/api/hosts/quarantine`).

6. `openresty/tests/README.md`
- Updated suite structure to include all active specs (`treasury_access`, `lab_manager_access`, `jwt_handler`).
- Simplified run instructions and coverage scope.

7. `tests/integration/README.md`
- Rewritten for concise, command-focused usage aligned with `run-integration.sh` and compose paths.

## Verified docs

- `README.md`
- `SUMMARY.md`
- `LOGGING.md`
- `configuring-lab-connections/guacamole-connections.md`
- `certbot/README.md`
- `ops-worker/README.md`
- `docs/install/INSTALLATION_GUIDE_EN.md`
- `docs/install/GUIA_INSTALACION_ES.md`
- `docs/edugain/EDUGAIN_INTEGRATION_EN.md`
- `docs/edugain/INTEGRACION_EDUGAIN_ES.md`
- `docs/tutorials/PROVIDER_TUTORIAL_EN.md`
- `docs/tutorials/TUTORIAL_PROVEEDOR_ES.md`
- `openresty/tests/README.md`
- `tests/integration/README.md`

## Remaining recommendation (optional)

Create one short "Docs map" page that defines:

- install path (`README.md` + `docs/install/*`)
- operations path (`LOGGING.md` + `ops-worker/README.md`)
- federation path (`docs/edugain/*`)
- provider path (`docs/tutorials/*` + `configuring-lab-connections/*`)

This reduces repeated instructions and keeps one source of truth per topic.
